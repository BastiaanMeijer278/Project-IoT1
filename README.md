# Project-IoT1

This was a project developed for the Wildlands Zoo for checking the location of animals inside of a stay. The data is represented in a Flask framework. The locations are visible in a generated map based on 3 beacons and a tag mounted on the animal. Due to covid we only got to develop this using fictional data.
